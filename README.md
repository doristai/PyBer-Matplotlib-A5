# PyBer Challenge 5 


## Overview

The purpose of the project is to analyse the raw data and trying to determine the total fare of uber by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) for each month. The data is parse into DataFrame and visualised using matplotlib.


## Results

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

The graph indicated the distinct difference in prices between rural, urban and suburban city types. Urban cities has the highest fares and the rural cities has the lowest fare from January to April. All city types have simialr trends which that January has the lowest fares and the peak in February. None of the city types intersect with one another. The urban fares started at $1800 on average and constantly increased along the time up to approximatelt $2300. Suburban fares on average started at $1000 on average, peaked in February and then constantly dropped from March to mid-April. Eventually, it started to increase up to ~$1400. On average, rural city fares started at ~$250, increased up to ~$450 in February, dropped in March and peaked in April up to $500.


## Summary

Percentage of Total Rides by City Type![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70616488/115101559-19651680-9efa-11eb-87a3-c975df1539fb.png)

Percentage of Total Drivers by City Type![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70616488/115101576-3c8fc600-9efa-11eb-8fa9-1f643839a845.png)

Both pie charts indicate that urban cities have the most drivers and riders which provides a more consistent price trend. Therefore, it is more reliable for establishing and expand the business in urban cities.
